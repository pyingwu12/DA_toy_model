# DA_toy_model
Different data assimilation algorithms for several toy models.

Just practices, not guaranteed to be correct.

- **Lorenz63_ETKF**: ETKF (ensemble transform Kalman filter) for Lorenz 63 (3 variable) model.

   Written in data assimilation class (Feb.-Jun., 2014) at National Central University, Taiwan.

- **KdV_4DVAR**: 4D-VAR for KdV equation.

   Written in Data assimilation summer school 2020 at Japan (Aug. 2020; online).

- **Lorenz96_PF_EKF**: KF (Kalman filter), EKF (extend Kalman filter), and PF (particle filter) for Lorenz 96 model.

   PF: Written in data assimilation class (Oct. 2019-Feb. 2020) at Kyoto University, Japan.

   KF and EKF: Written in data assimilation online school (Sep. 2020) held by RIKEN, Japan.
